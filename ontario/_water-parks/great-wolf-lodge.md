Great Wolf Lodge Niagara Falls, Ontario is designed for family togetherness and built for maximum fun. This 100,000 square foot indoor water park is always 84-degrees meaning you can race your friends and family down water slides any time of the year! 

For the adventure lovers there is the Canada Vortex water slide where you will drop 40 feet into a whirling, swirling basin to spin round and round.  Also Niagara Rapid Run - a roller coaster made for water!  In tandem tubes or even triple tubes, this water slide will have you twist and turn and plunge down a 52-foot vertical drop!  

There are also multiple smaller kids water slides and an interactive play station for the younger ones.  Plus the whole family will love the lazy river and wave pool.  

New to 2016 is the Wolf Tail - a water slide like no other! Once you step into the launch pad, the floor will drop out from under you and you will free fall down a 20 foot flume, followed by a 360 degree loop!

Plus Great Wolf Lodge also boasts tons of land activities such as MagiQuest, fireside Story Time, arcade games, Jammie Jamboree dance parties and more!

This indoor water park is reserved for hotel guests only.
