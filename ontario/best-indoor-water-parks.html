intro: |
  When the weather cools off the fun doesn’t have to!  

  Ontario winters can be cold, and long.  But that doesn’t mean that we cannot take a mini break to enjoy all of the fun and adventure of indoor water parks.

  Whether you are looking to relax in the wave pool, take a thrilling ride down a water slide, or just have a chance to switch from a winter coat to a bathing suit, we have an indoor water park that is right for you and your family.  

  So, grab your bathing suit, towel, underwater camera - no need to pack the sunscreen - and check out all of the fun you and your family can have this winter at an indoor water park near you!  

  From Niagara Falls to Muskoka, here are Water Parks in Ontario’s list of indoor water parks open year round:

      New to Great Wolf Lodge in 2016 is the Wolf Tail - a water slide like no other!  Once you step into the launch pad, the floor will drop out from under you and you will free fall down a 20 foot flume, followed by a 360 degree loop!  

      Plus Great Wolf Lodge also boasts tons of land activities such as MagiQuest, fireside Story Time, arcade games, Jammie Jamboree dance parties and more!
